To help unit test the `sum` function, here are diverse scenarios that the function should be able to handle:

1. Basic scenarios:
   - Sum of two positive integers: `sum(3, 4)` should return `7`
   - Sum of a positive integer and zero: `sum(5, 0)` should return `5`
   - Sum of two negative integers: `sum(-2, -3)` should return `-5`

2. Large numbers:
   - Sum of two large positive integers: `sum(1000000, 2000000)` should return `3000000`
   - Sum of a large positive integer and zero: `sum(999999, 0)` should return `999999`
   - Sum of two large negative integers: `sum(-1000000, -2000000)` should return `-3000000`

3. Edge cases:
   - Sum of two zeros: `sum(0, 0)` should return `0`
   - Sum of a positive integer and its negative counterpart: `sum(5, -5)` should return `0`
   - Sum of a negative integer and its positive counterpart: `sum(-7, 7)` should return `0`

4. Type checking:
   - Sum of two floating-point numbers: `sum(3.5, 4.2)` should raise a `TypeError`
   - Sum of a string and an integer: `sum("2", 3)` should raise a `TypeError`

5. Performance:
   - Sum of two very large positive integers: Test the performance of the function by measuring the time it takes to compute the sum of two large numbers, such as `sum(10**100, 10**100)`.

By testing these diverse scenarios, we can ensure that the `sum` function behaves correctly and handles a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and unexpected types.
