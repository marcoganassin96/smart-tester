Here are a few rare or unexpected edge cases to consider when unit testing the `sum` function:

1. Test cases involving non-integer inputs:
   - Floating-point numbers: `sum(3.14, 2.5)` should raise a `TypeError` since the function expects integer inputs.
   - Strings: `sum("10", "20")` should raise a `TypeError` since the function expects integer inputs.
   - None values: `sum(None, 5)` should raise a `TypeError` since the function expects integer inputs.

2. Test cases involving integer overflow:
   - Large positive integers that result in overflow: `sum(10000000000000000000, 20000000000000000000)` should raise an `OverflowError`.
   - Large negative integers that result in underflow: `sum(-10000000000000000000, -20000000000000000000)` should raise an `OverflowError`.

3. Test cases involving invalid argument types:
   - Missing arguments: `sum()` should raise a `TypeError` since the function expects two integer arguments.
   - Extra arguments: `sum(10, 20, 30)` should raise a `TypeError` since the function expects only two integer arguments.

4. Test cases involving unexpected behavior:
   - Non-numeric inputs: `sum("abc", "def")` should raise a `TypeError` since the function expects integer inputs.
   - Mixed numeric and non-numeric inputs: `sum(10, "20")` should raise a `TypeError` since the function expects integer inputs.
   - Inputs of different types: `sum(10, 3.14)` should raise a `TypeError` since the function expects integer inputs.

5. Test cases involving special integer values:
   - Zero and negative zero: `sum(0, -0)` should return `0` since zero and negative zero are considered equal.
   - Infinity: `sum(float('inf'), float('-inf'))` should raise a `TypeError` since the function expects integer inputs.

It's important to note that some of these edge cases may not be applicable or relevant depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the `sum` function.
