Here are some diverse scenarios that the `sum` function should be able to handle:

1. Basic scenarios:
   - `a` and `b` are positive integers: 
     - `sum(2, 3)` should return `5`
     - `sum(10, 20)` should return `30`
   - `a` and `b` are negative integers: 
     - `sum(-5, -10)` should return `-15`
     - `sum(-100, -200)` should return `-300`
   - `a` is positive and `b` is negative: 
     - `sum(5, -10)` should return `-5`
     - `sum(100, -200)` should return `-100`
   - `a` is negative and `b` is positive: 
     - `sum(-5, 10)` should return `5`
     - `sum(-100, 200)` should return `100`
   - `a` and `b` are zero: 
     - `sum(0, 0)` should return `0`
     - `sum(0, -5)` should return `-5`

2. Edge cases:
   - Large integers: 
     - `sum(1000000, 2000000)` should return `3000000`
     - `sum(-1000000, -2000000)` should return `-3000000`
   - One or both arguments are `None`:
     - `sum(None, 5)` should raise a `TypeError`
     - `sum(10, None)` should raise a `TypeError`
     - `sum(None, None)` should raise a `TypeError`
   - One or both arguments are not integers:
     - `sum(3.14, 5)` should raise a `TypeError`
     - `sum(10, "20")` should raise a `TypeError`
     - `sum("hello", "world")` should raise a `TypeError`

3. Special cases:
   - `a` and `b` are equal:
     - `sum(5, 5)` should return `10`
     - `sum(-10, -10)` should return `-20`
   - `a` or `b` is a very large number:
     - `sum(1000000000000000000000000, 1)` should return `1000000000000000000000001`
     - `sum(-999999999999999999999999, 1000000000000000000000000)` should return `1`

These scenarios cover a wide range of possible inputs and edge cases to ensure that the `sum` function behaves correctly in various situations.
