To unit test the `sum` function, we can consider the following scenarios:

1. Test the function's behavior for a wide range of possible inputs:
   - Positive integers: `sum(5, 10)` should return `15`
   - Negative integers: `sum(-5, -10)` should return `-15`
   - Zero: `sum(0, 0)` should return `0`
   - Large integers: `sum(1000000, 2000000)` should return `3000000`

2. Test edge cases that the author may not have foreseen:
   - One of the inputs is zero: `sum(0, 10)` should return `10`
   - One of the inputs is a large negative number: `sum(-1000000, 500000)` should return `-500000`
   - One of the inputs is a large positive number: `sum(1000000, 500000)` should return `1500000`

3. Take advantage of the features of `pytest` to make the tests easy to write and maintain:
   - Use `pytest` fixtures to set up common test data, such as `a` and `b` values for different test cases.
   - Use parameterized tests to test multiple inputs and expected outputs in a single test function.

4. Be easy to read and understand, with clean code and descriptive names:
   - Use descriptive test function names, such as `test_sum_positive_integers` or `test_sum_large_numbers`.
   - Use clear variable names for inputs and expected outputs, such as `a`, `b`, and `expected_result`.
   - Use assertions to check if the actual result matches the expected result, such as `assert sum(a, b) == expected_result`.

5. Be deterministic, so that the tests always pass or fail in the same way:
   - Ensure that the tests do not rely on external factors or random values.
   - Avoid using non-deterministic operations, such as reading from a file or generating random numbers, in the tests.
