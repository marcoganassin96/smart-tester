- The function is named `sum`.
- It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be integers.
- The return type of the function is specified as `int`.
- The function body consists of a single line of code, which calculates the sum of `a` and `b` using the `+` operator.
- The result of the addition is then returned as the output of the function.

The author's intentions may have been to create a simple function that adds two integers together and returns the sum. The use of type hints (`a: int, b: int`) suggests that the author wanted to ensure that the function is used with integer arguments. The return type hint (`-> int`) indicates that the author intended for the function to always return an integer value.
