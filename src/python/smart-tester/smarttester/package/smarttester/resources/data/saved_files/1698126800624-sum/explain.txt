Here is an explanation of the given Python function:

- The function is named `sum`.
- It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be integers.
- The function has a return type annotation `-> int`, indicating that it will return an integer.
- Inside the function, the values of `a` and `b` are added together using the `+` operator.
- The result of the addition is then returned as the output of the function.

The author's intentions may have been:

- To create a simple function that calculates the sum of two integers.
- By specifying the types of the parameters and the return type, the author is indicating the expected input and output of the function.
- The use of type annotations can help with code readability and can also be used by type checkers and IDEs to provide better code analysis and suggestions.
