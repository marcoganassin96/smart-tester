- The function should be able to handle very large integers that may exceed the maximum value that can be represented:
    - Example: `sum(9223372036854775807, 1)` should return `9223372036854775808` (the maximum value that can be represented by a 64-bit signed integer)
    - Example: `sum(999999999999999999999999, 1)` should return `1000000000000000000000000`
- The function should be able to handle very small integers that may exceed the minimum value that can be represented:
    - Example: `sum(-9223372036854775808, -1)` should return `-9223372036854775809` (the minimum value that can be represented by a 64-bit signed integer)
    - Example: `sum(-999999999999999999999999, -1)` should return `-1000000000000000000000000`
- The function should be able to handle cases where the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be represented:
    - Example: `sum(9223372036854775807, 2)` should raise an `OverflowError` since the sum exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a 64-bit signed integer
- The function should be able to handle cases where the sum is below the minimum value that can be represented:
    - Example: `sum(-9223372036854775808, -2)` should raise an `OverflowError` since the sum is below the minimum value that can be represented by a 64-bit signed integer
- The function should be able to handle cases where the sum results in a floating-point number:
    - Example: `sum(3, 2.5)` should raise a `TypeError` since the sum is a float
    - Example: `sum(2.5, 3.5)` should raise a `TypeError` since both arguments are floats

By considering these rare or unexpected edge cases, we can ensure that the function handles unusual inputs gracefully and does not produce unexpected results or errors.
