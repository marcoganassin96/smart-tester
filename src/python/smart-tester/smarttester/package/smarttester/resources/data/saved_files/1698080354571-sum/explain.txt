- The function is named `sum`.
- It takes two parameters: `a` and `b`, both of type `int`.
- The function returns an integer value.
- The function body consists of a single line, which adds `a` and `b` together using the `+` operator.
- The author's intention is to create a function that calculates the sum of two integers.
- The function uses type hints to indicate that the parameters `a` and `b` should be integers (`int`) and that the return value should also be an integer (`int`). This provides clarity and helps with code documentation.
- The function does not have any error handling or validation for the input parameters. It assumes that the input will always be valid integers.
- The function does not have any additional functionality or logic. It simply adds the two input parameters and returns the result.
