- The function is named `sum`.
- It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are expected to be integers.
- The function has a return type annotation of `int`, indicating that it is expected to return an integer.
- The function body consists of a single line of code: `return a + b`.
- The line `return a + b` adds the values of `a` and `b` together and returns the result.
- The intention of the author seems to be to create a function that calculates the sum of two integers and returns the result.
