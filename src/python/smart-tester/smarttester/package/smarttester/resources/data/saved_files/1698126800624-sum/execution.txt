In the above code, we have written a suite of unit tests for the `sum` function using `pytest`. Here's a breakdown of the code:

- We import the necessary packages, including `pytest`.
- The `sum` function is defined as provided in the question.
- The unit tests are defined using the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator. Each test case is represented by a tuple containing the input values `a` and `b`, as well as the expected output `expected`.
- The test cases cover the basic scenarios, large numbers, edge cases, type checking, overflow, different integer types, non-integer inputs, and unusual numeric representations.
- For the test cases that are expected to raise an exception, we use `pytest.mark.xfail` to mark them as expected failures and specify the expected exception type using the `raises` parameter.
- The `test_sum` function asserts that the result of calling the `sum` function with the input values `a` and `b` matches the expected output `expected`.

By running these unit tests, we can verify that the `sum` function behaves correctly for a wide range of inputs and handles the specified scenarios, including edge cases and unexpected behavior.
